# Dynamic Seasons
 
The mod adds all 4 seasons (spring, summer, autumn and winter). Each of the seasons has its own visual palette, temperatures, sunset/sunrise times, weather and everything else you expect with an actual seasonal climate.  Winter will of course have snow coverage, similiar to the one in red dead onlines winter event and late autumn/early spring, will characterize with more snow near the mountains! Every season has a carefully fine tuned color palette.
